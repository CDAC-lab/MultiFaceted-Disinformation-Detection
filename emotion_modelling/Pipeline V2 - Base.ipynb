It’s not clear if Facebook has provided an explanation for the group’s removal.\\n\\nVisiting the page gives the following message: “Sorry, this content isn’t available right now.”\\n\\nGarrett Soldano of Mattawan, Michigan created Michiganders Against Excessive Quarantine in April after becoming disenchanted with Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home order – a policy which he initially supported.\\n\\nThe group made headlines around the world after organizing ‘Operation Gridlock’, a protest in which thousands of cars created bumper-to-bumper traffic in the capital, Lansing.\\n\\nProtesters were encouraged to stay in their automobiles and adhere to social distancing guidelines. However, several hundred demonstrators ended up rallying outside the state house.\\n\\nMany members of the group used the space to talk about the depression and financial hardships that they were experiencing as a result of the governor’s executive orders, first enacted in March 23, which have forced all ‘non-essential’ businesses and to remain closed. Whitmer unilaterally extended her emergency powers in May, after the legislature voted to let them expire. The governor has used these executive powers as the legal basis for the state’s lockdown.\\n\\n“They will not silence us,” Soldano said in a video message after the group was deleted.\\n\\n“This just proves to all of us out there that we were right. That there is a deep agenda going on. They’re trying to keep us quiet… Now we fight back. And we have the numbers.”\\n\\nFor now, the message is unavailable on Facebook. On Wednesday, Soldano began promoting a new page, Stand Up Michigan, which gained thousands of members before also being pulled from the site.\\n\\nThe removal of Soldan’s anti-lockdown group has not gone unnoticed on social media. Former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson described the decision to pull the page as a clear example of “censorship.”\\n\\nSome challenged the notion, apparently arguing that the group’s beliefs were not worthy of being protected. Even Elon Musk, who re-opened his Tesla plant in California in defiance of local officials, weighed in. Last month, Facebook deleted anti-lockdown pages that were organizing demonstrations in California, Nebraska, and New Jersey, claiming that the groups were in violation of those states’ stay-at-home orders.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the tech giant announced that it would be working with fact-checkers to “stop the spread of misinformation and harmful content about Covid-19.” An update regarding the policy, dated May 12, states that the platform put warning labels on around 50 million “pieces of content related to Covid-19.” '"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":125}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dff.info()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"23YXeBewPyHa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647522887911,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":602,"user":{"displayName":"Kirishnni Prabagar","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GijMBz-0AYFV6ZIzcpArQsAv8sjFpRRnktAr5CO=s64","userId":"04620989033649193985"}},"outputId":"64522b28-dfb1-4483-dc8c-fa218712a7a5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","Int64Index: 3118 entries, 0 to 3118\n","Data columns (total 5 columns):\n"," #

Jones will be the first Democrat sent to the Senate from Republican stronghold Alabama in a quarter century. When he takes office, Republicans’ majority in the chamber will narrow to 51 of the 100 seats. Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, Attorney General Steve Marshall and Secretary of State John Merrill will meet to certify Jones’ win, Merrill’s office said in a statement. Jones’ margin of victory was 1.5 percentage points. Moore has not conceded defeat in the Dec. 12 vote, despite being urged by President Donald Trump to do so.
