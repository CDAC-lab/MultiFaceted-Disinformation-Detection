# MultiFaceted-Disinformation-Detection

A novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) approachthat leverages the multi-faceted composition of disinformation for accurate and real time detection. 

The approach consists of modelling pipelines that focus on the three facets of emotional intensity and temperature, semantics of the use of language, and the structural organisation of the content. 

We demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-faceted AI approach using an empirical evaluation across five benchmark big datasets
